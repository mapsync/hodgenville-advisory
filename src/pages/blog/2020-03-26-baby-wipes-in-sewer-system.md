Due to the limited supply of toilet paper, other city sewer systems have ran into the issue of a excessive amount of baby wipes being flushed and it is causing the sewer systems to fail. Please only flush toilet paper into Hodgenvilleâ€™s sewer system. It can be very costly and detrimental to the city. It is also a possibility it can be traced back to your residence. If that happens the cost can be passed onto you. We appreciate your understanding during this time and we all will get through this together. Thank you.
